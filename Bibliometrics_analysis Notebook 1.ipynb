However, despite all their advantages, in connection to their widespread application in the food industry, negative consequences such as an uncontrolled phage spread as well as a development of phage resistant bacteria can occur. These problems are mostly a result of long-term persistence of phages in the food production environment. As this topic has been neglected so far, this article reviews the current knowledge regarding the effectiveness of disinfectant strategies for phage inactivation and removal. For this purpose, the main commercial phage products, as well as their application fields are first discussed in terms of applicable inactivation strategies and legal regulations. Secondly, an overview of the effectiveness of disinfectants for bacteriophage inactivation in general and commercial phages in particular is given. Finally, this review outlines a possible strategy for users of commercial phage products in order to improve the effectiveness of phage inactivation and removal after application.\",\n          \"Iran, with its unique climatic and topographic conditions, is home to about 8200 species of vascular plants. Approximately 2300 of the 8200 species are popularly characterized as medicinal or aromatic. Here, we compile information about the endemic medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) of Iran and map their distributions. Our survey found 180 endemic species of MAPs, belonging to 10 families and 30 genera. The majority of species are found in Lamiaceae, Fabaceae, and Apiaceae, with 86, 30, and 18 species, respectively. Approximately 70% of these plants have been recorded in the 10 provinces of Esfahan, Kerman, Fars, Tehran, Chaharmahal va Bakhtiari, East Azarbaijan, Lorestan, West Azarbaijan, Hamadan, and Mazandaran. These provinces are located in the Iran-o-Turanian region, one of the three major phytogeographic regions in Iran, which covers five areas of endemism (i.e., Azarbaijan, Zagros, Kopet Dagh-Khorassan, Alborz, and Central Alborz). So, Iran-o-Turanian region is the main center of diversity for the Iranian endemic MAPs. The north, center and western parts of Iran are rich in MAPs and could be considered as the dominant biodiversity hotspots of Iran more seemingly due to the diverse climatic and geographic assortment which generates the highest frequency and distribution of MAPs. Many of these MAPs are at the edge of extinction due to the unwise, unscientific harvesting and/or global climate change. Therefore, there is an urgent need to conserve and propagate some of these important MAPs to save them from extinction and also to ensure the availability of raw materials for their use and future research into their efficacy. Furthermore, identifying the areas of endemism (AEs) is an essential part of ongoing regional conservation management programs in Iran and worldwide.\",\n          \"Malachra alceifolia Jacq. (family Malvaceae), known as \\u201cmalva,\\u201d is a medicinal plant used as a traditional therapy in many regions of America, Africa and Asia. Traditionally, this plant is used in the form of extracts, powder and paste by populations for treating fever, stomachache, inflammation, and parasites. However, the ethnopharmacological validation of M. alceifolia has been scarcely researched. This study showed that the chloroform fraction (MA-IC) and subfraction (MA-24F) of the leaves of M. alceifolia exhibited a potential antileishmanial activity against axenic amastigotes of Leishmania mexicana pifanoi (MHOM/VE/60/Ltrod) and had high and moderate cytotoxic effects on the viability and morphology of macrophages RAW 264.7. This study reports, for the first time, possible terpenoid metabolites and derivatives present in M. alceifolia with activity against some biosynthetic pathways in L. mexicana amastigotes. The compounds from the subfractions MA-24F were highly active and were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and by a molecular docking study in L. mexicana target protein. This study demonstrates the potential modes of interaction and the theoretical affinity energy of the metabolites episwertenol, \\u03b1-amyrin and methyl commate A, which are present in the active fraction MA-24F, at allosteric sites of the pyruvate kinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, triose phosphate isomerase, aldolase, phosphoglucose isomerase, transketolase, arginase and cysteine peptidases A, target proteins in some vital biosynthetic pathways were responsible for the survival of L. mexicana. Some phytoconstituents of M. alceifolia can be used for the search for potential new drugs and molecular targets for treating leishmaniases and infectious diseases. Furthermore, contributions to research and the validation and conservation of traditional knowledge of medicinal plants are needed globally.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Paper_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 13,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Journal Article', 'Journal Article', 'Editorial']\",\n          \"['Journal Article', 'Journal Article', 'News']\",\n          \"['Journal Article', 'Review']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Screening"],"metadata":{"id":"GOIXMqb56y-O"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["table_1_with_PT = df.drop(df[df[\"Paper_type\"] == \"NaN\"].index)\n","table_1_with_PT.info()"],"metadata":{"id":"jEBa8aZk53e8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1727865694224,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":388,"user":{"displayName":"Aliyu D Abdullahi","userId":"02187426347476081881"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"26311284-d4d1-49b0-db5f-ec9070aaba86"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 8251 entries, 0 to 8250\n","Data columns (total 6 columns):\n"," #   Column      Non-Null Count  Dtype  \n","---  ------      --------------  -----  \n"," 0   Journal     8251 non-null   object \n"," 1   Title       8251 non-null   object \n"," 2   Authors     8251 non-null   object \n"," 3   Year        8022 non-null   float64\n"," 4   Abstract    8198 non-null   object \n"," 5   Paper_type  8251 non-null   object \n","dtypes: float64(1), object(5)\n","memory usage: 386.9+ KB\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#drop records without Paper type\n","table_1_with_PT = df.drop(df[df[\"Paper_type\"] == \"No paper type\"].index)\n","table_1_with_PT"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":597},"id":"46YEsWLR6CCh","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1727865698241,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":417,"user":{"displayName":"Aliyu D Abdullahi","userId":"02187426347476081881"}},"outputId":"24c66b19-de83-4cc6-d662-65363728d669"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                Journal  \\\n","0                         Clinical Microbiology Reviews   \n","1            BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine   \n","2     Molecules : A Journal of Synthetic Chemistry a...   \n","3              BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies   \n","4                                               Viruses   \n","...                                                 ...   \n","8246                          ACS Chemical Neuroscience   \n","8247                         Acta Pharmacologica Sinica   \n","8248                                           PLoS ONE   \n","8249                                          Molecules   \n","8250                                 Scientific Reports   \n","\n","                                                  Title  \\\n","0     Natural-Product-Based Solutions for Tropical I...   \n","1     Antibacterial activities, proposed mode of act...   \n","2     Anti-Trypanosomatid Elemanolide Sesquiterpene ...   \n","3     Phytochemical analysis and versatile in vitro ...   \n","4     Antiviral and Cytotoxic Activity of Different ...   \n","...                                                 ...   \n","8246  Tanshinones Inhibit Amyloid Aggregation by Amy...   \n","8247  Salvianolic acid B ameliorates depressive-like...   \n","8248  Cardiac Microvascular Barrier Function Mediate...   \n","8249  Production of Salvianolic Acid B in Roots of S...   \n","8250  Network pharmacology and molecular docking stu...   \n","\n","                                                Authors    Year  \\\n","0     Adegboye, Oyelola; Field, Matt A.; Kupz, Andre...

However, despite all their advantages, in connection to their widespread application in the food industry, negative consequences such as an uncontrolled phage spread as well as a development of phage resistant bacteria can occur. These problems are mostly a result of long-term persistence of phages in the food production environment. As this topic has been neglected so far, this article reviews the current knowledge regarding the effectiveness of disinfectant strategies for phage inactivation and removal. For this purpose, the main commercial phage products, as well as their application fields are first discussed in terms of applicable inactivation strategies and legal regulations. Secondly, an overview of the effectiveness of disinfectants for bacteriophage inactivation in general and commercial phages in particular is given. Finally, this review outlines a possible strategy for users of commercial phage products in order to improve the effectiveness of phage inactivation and removal after application.\",\n          \"Iran, with its unique climatic and topographic conditions, is home to about 8200 species of vascular plants. Approximately 2300 of the 8200 species are popularly characterized as medicinal or aromatic. Here, we compile information about the endemic medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) of Iran and map their distributions. Our survey found 180 endemic species of MAPs, belonging to 10 families and 30 genera. The majority of species are found in Lamiaceae, Fabaceae, and Apiaceae, with 86, 30, and 18 species, respectively. Approximately 70% of these plants have been recorded in the 10 provinces of Esfahan, Kerman, Fars, Tehran, Chaharmahal va Bakhtiari, East Azarbaijan, Lorestan, West Azarbaijan, Hamadan, and Mazandaran. These provinces are located in the Iran-o-Turanian region, one of the three major phytogeographic regions in Iran, which covers five areas of endemism (i.e., Azarbaijan, Zagros, Kopet Dagh-Khorassan, Alborz, and Central Alborz). So, Iran-o-Turanian region is the main center of diversity for the Iranian endemic MAPs. The north, center and western parts of Iran are rich in MAPs and could be considered as the dominant biodiversity hotspots of Iran more seemingly due to the diverse climatic and geographic assortment which generates the highest frequency and distribution of MAPs. Many of these MAPs are at the edge of extinction due to the unwise, unscientific harvesting and/or global climate change. Therefore, there is an urgent need to conserve and propagate some of these important MAPs to save them from extinction and also to ensure the availability of raw materials for their use and future research into their efficacy. Furthermore, identifying the areas of endemism (AEs) is an essential part of ongoing regional conservation management programs in Iran and worldwide.\",\n          \"Malachra alceifolia Jacq. (family Malvaceae), known as \\u201cmalva,\\u201d is a medicinal plant used as a traditional therapy in many regions of America, Africa and Asia. Traditionally, this plant is used in the form of extracts, powder and paste by populations for treating fever, stomachache, inflammation, and parasites. However, the ethnopharmacological validation of M. alceifolia has been scarcely researched. This study showed that the chloroform fraction (MA-IC) and subfraction (MA-24F) of the leaves of M. alceifolia exhibited a potential antileishmanial activity against axenic amastigotes of Leishmania mexicana pifanoi (MHOM/VE/60/Ltrod) and had high and moderate cytotoxic effects on the viability and morphology of macrophages RAW 264.7. This study reports, for the first time, possible terpenoid metabolites and derivatives present in M. alceifolia with activity against some biosynthetic pathways in L. mexicana amastigotes. The compounds from the subfractions MA-24F were highly active and were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and by a molecular docking study in L. mexicana target protein. This study demonstrates the potential modes of interaction and the theoretical affinity energy of the metabolites episwertenol, \\u03b1-amyrin and methyl commate A, which are present in the active fraction MA-24F, at allosteric sites of the pyruvate kinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, triose phosphate isomerase, aldolase, phosphoglucose isomerase, transketolase, arginase and cysteine peptidases A, target proteins in some vital biosynthetic pathways were responsible for the survival of L. mexicana. Some phytoconstituents of M. alceifolia can be used for the search for potential new drugs and molecular targets for treating leishmaniases and infectious diseases. Furthermore, contributions to research and the validation and conservation of traditional knowledge of medicinal plants are needed globally.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Paper_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 13,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Journal Article', 'Journal Article', 'Editorial']\",\n          \"['Journal Article', 'Journal Article', 'News']\",\n          \"['Journal Article', 'Review']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":6}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["table_1_with_PT.info()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"d-QsHHBrJnSO","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1727865709805,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":390,"user":{"displayName":"Aliyu D Abdullahi","userId":"02187426347476081881"}},"outputId":"311210b0-8b92-4782-923a-01bcb26b48a7"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 8251 entries, 0 to 8250\n","Data columns (total 6 columns):\n"," #

Although surgery together with neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy has improved survival for localized OSA, most patients develop recurrent/metastatic disease with a dismally poor outcome. Therapeutic options have not improved for these OSA patients in recent decades. As OSA is a rare and \\u201corphan\\u201d tumor, with no distinct targetable driver antigens, the development of new efficient therapies is still an unmet and challenging clinical need. Appropriate animal models are therefore critical for advancement in the field. Despite the undoubted relevance of pre-clinical mouse models in cancer research, they present some intrinsic limitations that may be responsible for the low translational success of novel therapies from the pre-clinical setting to the clinic. From this context emerges the concept of comparative oncology, which has spurred the study of pet dogs as a uniquely valuable model of spontaneous OSA that develops in an immune-competent system with high biological and clinical similarities to corresponding human tumors, including in its metastatic behavior and resistance to conventional therapies. For these reasons, the translational power of studies conducted on OSA-bearing dogs has seen increasing recognition. The most recent and relevant veterinary investigations of novel combinatorial approaches, with a focus on immune-based strategies, that can most likely benefit both canine and human OSA patients have been summarized in this commentary.\",\n          \"Background: Glycyrrhiza glabra (G. glabra), known as liquorice root is one such herbal remedy that has been shown to have immense potential in the treatment of orofacial diseases. Aim: To evaluate the remineralizing potential of liquorice extract on initial enamel carious lesions. Materials and methods: An in vitro and in vivo study was conducted, wherein the sound-extracted human premolars were sectioned longitudinally and into enamel blocks of size 4 \\u00d7 4 mm. Enamel blocks were demineralized to produce artificial carious lesions. In vitro study, the demineralized enamel block was exposed to artificial saliva for 5 minutes and artificial saliva containing liquorice for 4 minutes 14 times in a sequential manner. An in vivo study was carried out on six volunteers aged between 6 and 12 years. The demineralized enamel block was inserted into the 5 \\u00d7 5 mm window created on the full palatal coverage appliance. Patients were given commercially available liquorice candies (Ricola) to consume for 7 days twice daily. The remineralization potential of liquorice on demineralized enamel block was assessed using confocal microscopy analysis. Results: Liquorice extract containing candies showed visual remineralization of the demineralized area on the enamel surface through confocal images. Conclusion: Liquorice extract possesses remineralizing potential with its other medicinal properties. \\u2003 How to cite this article: Pooja HR, Nagar P, Mascarenhas AN, et al.

Propolis, a traditional and potentially medicinal product with several health benefits, is a beehive product with a worldwide reputation. However, despite the bioactivities reported, the low productivity and high chemical heterogeneity have been extensively hampering broader industrial uses. To assist in overcoming some of these problems, we prepared and characterized mixtures of ethanol extracts of a heterogeneous propolis sample (Pereiro) collected over a five-year period (2011\\u20132015) and, additionally, we mixed two different propolis samples from distinct regions of Portugal (Pereiro and Ger\\u00eas), also harvested at different times. An investigation of the antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, as well as characterization of the chemical composition of the eleven propolis blends were performed in this work. The antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of such blends of propolis samples, either from different localities and/or different years, were maintained, or even enhanced, when a comparison of the individual extracts was conducted. The differences in the chemical composition of the original propolis samples were also diluted in the mixtures. The results reemphasize the great potential of propolis and suggest that mixing different samples, regardless of provenance or harvesting date, can contribute to propolis standardization while simultaneously increasing its availability and adding value to this beehive byproduct.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Paper_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Journal Article']\",\n          \"['Journal Article', 'Journal Article']\",\n          \"['Journal Article', 'Journal Article', 'Editorial']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":16}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["table_1_filter[table_1_filter[\"Abstract\"] == \"NaN\"]\n","table_1_filter"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":597},"id":"6bpTxsMeLVKJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1727866071215,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":429,"user":{"displayName":"Aliyu D Abdullahi","userId":"02187426347476081881"}},"outputId":"fd59f103-e445-4d16-b971-ea79e076f6ce"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                Journal  \\\n","1            BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine   \n","2     Molecules : A Journal of Synthetic Chemistry a...   \n","3              BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies   \n","4                                               Viruses   \n","5                                             Molecules   \n","...                                                 ...   \n","8246                          ACS Chemical Neuroscience   \n","8247                         Acta Pharmacologica Sinica   \n","8248                                           PLoS ONE   \n","8249                                          Molecules   \n","8250                                 Scientific Reports   \n","\n","                                                  Title  \\\n","1     Antibacterial activities, proposed mode of act...   \n","2     Anti-Trypanosomatid Elemanolide Sesquiterpene ...   \n","3     Phytochemical analysis and versatile in vitro ...   \n","4     Antiviral and Cytotoxic Activity of Different ...   \n","5     Antiprotozoal Activity of Plants Used in the M...   \n","...                                                 ...   \n","8246  Tanshinones Inhibit Amyloid Aggregation by Amy...   \n","8247  Salvianolic acid B ameliorates depressive-like...   \n","8248  Cardiac Microvascular Barrier Function Mediate...   \n","8249  Production of Salvianolic Acid B in Roots of S...   \n","8250  Network pharmacology and molecular docking stu...   \n","\n","                                                Authors    Year  \\\n","1              Mombeshora, Molly; Mukanganyama, Stanley  2019.0   \n","2     Kimani, Njogu M.; Matasyoh, Josphat C.; Kaiser...  2017.0   \n","3     Jan, Hasnain; Usman, Hazrat; Shah, Muzamil; Za...  2021.0   \n","4     Panda, Sujogya Kumar; Castro, Ana Hortência Fo...  2020.0   \n","5     Vahekeni, Nina; Brillatz, Théo; Rahmaty, Marja...  2024.0   \n","...                                                 ...     ...   \n","8246  Wang, Qiuming; Yu, Xiang; Patal, Kunal; Hu, Ru...  2013.0   \n","8247  Zhang, Jin-qiang; Wu, Xiao-hui; Feng, Yi; Xie,...  2016.0   \n","8248  Qi, Kang; Li, Lujin; Li, Xiangdong; Zhao, Jing...  2015.0   \n","8249  Li, Xiao-Bing; Wang, Wei; Zhou, Guo-Jun; Li, Y...  2012.0   \n","8250  Zhang, Mingxu; Yang, Jiawei; Zhao, Xiulan; Zha...  2021.0   \n","\n","                                               Abstract           Paper_type  \n","1     Background: Pseudomonas aeruginosa has become ...

Although surgery together with neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy has improved survival for localized OSA, most patients develop recurrent/metastatic disease with a dismally poor outcome. Therapeutic options have not improved for these OSA patients in recent decades. As OSA is a rare and \\u201corphan\\u201d tumor, with no distinct targetable driver antigens, the development of new efficient therapies is still an unmet and challenging clinical need. Appropriate animal models are therefore critical for advancement in the field. Despite the undoubted relevance of pre-clinical mouse models in cancer research, they present some intrinsic limitations that may be responsible for the low translational success of novel therapies from the pre-clinical setting to the clinic. From this context emerges the concept of comparative oncology, which has spurred the study of pet dogs as a uniquely valuable model of spontaneous OSA that develops in an immune-competent system with high biological and clinical similarities to corresponding human tumors, including in its metastatic behavior and resistance to conventional therapies. For these reasons, the translational power of studies conducted on OSA-bearing dogs has seen increasing recognition. The most recent and relevant veterinary investigations of novel combinatorial approaches, with a focus on immune-based strategies, that can most likely benefit both canine and human OSA patients have been summarized in this commentary.\",\n          \"Background: Glycyrrhiza glabra (G. glabra), known as liquorice root is one such herbal remedy that has been shown to have immense potential in the treatment of orofacial diseases. Aim: To evaluate the remineralizing potential of liquorice extract on initial enamel carious lesions. Materials and methods: An in vitro and in vivo study was conducted, wherein the sound-extracted human premolars were sectioned longitudinally and into enamel blocks of size 4 \\u00d7 4 mm. Enamel blocks were demineralized to produce artificial carious lesions. In vitro study, the demineralized enamel block was exposed to artificial saliva for 5 minutes and artificial saliva containing liquorice for 4 minutes 14 times in a sequential manner. An in vivo study was carried out on six volunteers aged between 6 and 12 years. The demineralized enamel block was inserted into the 5 \\u00d7 5 mm window created on the full palatal coverage appliance. Patients were given commercially available liquorice candies (Ricola) to consume for 7 days twice daily. The remineralization potential of liquorice on demineralized enamel block was assessed using confocal microscopy analysis. Results: Liquorice extract containing candies showed visual remineralization of the demineralized area on the enamel surface through confocal images. Conclusion: Liquorice extract possesses remineralizing potential with its other medicinal properties. \\u2003 How to cite this article: Pooja HR, Nagar P, Mascarenhas AN, et al.

Propolis, a traditional and potentially medicinal product with several health benefits, is a beehive product with a worldwide reputation. However, despite the bioactivities reported, the low productivity and high chemical heterogeneity have been extensively hampering broader industrial uses. To assist in overcoming some of these problems, we prepared and characterized mixtures of ethanol extracts of a heterogeneous propolis sample (Pereiro) collected over a five-year period (2011\\u20132015) and, additionally, we mixed two different propolis samples from distinct regions of Portugal (Pereiro and Ger\\u00eas), also harvested at different times. An investigation of the antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, as well as characterization of the chemical composition of the eleven propolis blends were performed in this work. The antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of such blends of propolis samples, either from different localities and/or different years, were maintained, or even enhanced, when a comparison of the individual extracts was conducted. The differences in the chemical composition of the original propolis samples were also diluted in the mixtures.

The influences of temperature fluctuation on the contents of total anthocyanin, phenolic, malondialdehyde, and sodium carbonate-soluble pectin (SSP), as well as the activities of polyphenoloxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) in sweet cherry, were assessed. In addition, the effects of temperature fluctuation on the activities of polygalacturonase (PG), pectin methyl esterase (PME), and beta-galactosidase (\\u03b2-Gal) activities, and the paPG, paPME, and paPME genes expression were studied. The evolution of SSP nano-morphology was measured by atomic force microscopy. The results showed that the temperature fluctuation promoted anthocyanin synthesis, phenolic metabolism, and malondialdehyde accumulation, which immediately affected the brightness (6.2% lower than that of the cherry stored at 5 \\u00b0C) of sweet cherry. Temperature fluctuation also led to a significant increase in POD and PPO activities during subsequent isothermal storage, accelerating the colour change (24.8% more than that of the cherry stored at 5 \\u00b0C), which almost reached the level observed during constant 10 \\u00b0C storage. In addition, temperature fluctuation not only affected the firmness (13.7% lower than that of the cherry stored at a constant temperature of 5 \\u00b0C) of fruit immediately, but also, during subsequent isothermal storage, accelerated the deterioration of firmness (19.6% lower than that of the cherry stored at a constant temperature of 5 \\u00b0C). This could be explained by temperature fluctuation inducing the upregulation of paPG1-3, paPME3, and paPME4 expression, which led to a 3.5 and 1.5-fold increase in PG and PME activity, respectively. This led to degradation of the aggregated SSP to its nanostructural basic units. Furthermore, temperature fluctuation resulted in upregulated expression of pa\\u03b2-Gal1 and pa\\u03b2-Gal3 and enhanced \\u03b2-Gal activity during subsequent isothermal storage. The results provide theoretical guidance for the transportation, storage, and preservation of postharvest sweet cherry.\",\n          \"Abstract: Plant cell growth is regulated through manipulation of the cell wall network, which consists of oriented cellulose microfibrils embedded within a ground matrix incorporating pectin and hemicellulose components. There remain many unknowns as to how this manipulation occurs. Experiments have shown that cellulose reorients in cell walls as the cell expands, while recent data suggest that growth is controlled by distinct collections of hemicellulose called biomechanical hotspots, which join the cellulose molecule together. The enzymes expansin and Cel12A have both been shown to induce growth of the cell wall; however, while Cel12A\\u2019s wall-loosening action leads to a reduction in the cell wall strength, expansin\\u2019s has been shown to increase the strength of the cell wall. In contrast, members of the XTH enzyme family hydrolyse hemicellulose but do not appear to cause wall creep. This experimentally observed behaviour still awaits a full explanation. We derive and analyse a mathematical model for the effective mechanical properties of the evolving cell wall network, incorporating cellulose microfibrils, which reorient with cell growth and are linked via biomechanical hotspots made up of regions of crosslinking hemicellulose. Assuming a visco-elastic response for the cell wall and using a continuum approach, we calculate the total stress resultant of the cell wall for a given overall growth rate. By changing appropriate parameters affecting breakage rate and viscous properties, we provide evidence for the biomechanical hotspot hypothesis and develop mechanistic understanding of the growth-inducing enzymes. Graphic Abstract:\",\n          \"Red yeasts of the genus Rhodotorula are of great interest to the biotechnological industry due to their ability to produce valuable natural products, such as lipids and carotenoids with potential applications as surfactants, food additives, and pharmaceuticals. Herein, we explored the biosynthetic potential of R. mucilaginosa 50-3-19/20B collected from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge using modern genomics and untargeted metabolomics tools. R. mucilaginosa 50-3-19/20B exhibited anticancer activity when grown on PDA medium, while antimicrobial activity was observed when cultured on WSP-30 medium. Applying the bioactive molecular networking approach, the anticancer activity was linked to glycolipids, namely polyol esters of fatty acid (PEFA) derivatives. We purified four PEFAs (1\\u20134) and the known methyl-2-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-2-yl)propanoate (5). Their structures were deduced from NMR and HR-MS/MS spectra, but 1\\u20135 showed no anticancer activity in their pure form. Illumina-based genome sequencing, de novo assembly and standard biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) analyses were used to illustrate key components of the PEFA biosynthetic pathway. The fatty acid producing BGC3 was identified to be capable of producing precursors of PEFAs. Some Rhodotorula strains are able to convert inulin into high-yielding PEFA and cell lipid using a native exo-inulinase enzyme. The genomic locus for an exo-inulinase enzyme (g1629.t1), which plays an instrumental role in the PEFA production via the mannitol biosynthesis pathway, was identified. This is the first untargeted metabolomics study on R. mucilaginosa providing new genomic insights into PEFA biosynthesis.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Paper_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Journal Article']\",\n          \"['Journal Article', 'Journal Article']\",\n          \"['Journal Article', 'Journal Article', 'Editorial']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":21}]}]}
